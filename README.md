# updogfx
Updogfx is inspired by Updog. Initially, it was not supported in Termux. However, we developed it to be compatible with Termux, requiring minimal resources. It serves as a replacement for Python's SimpleHTTPServer. Updogfx facilitates both uploading and downloading via HTTP/S with the help of android browser.
